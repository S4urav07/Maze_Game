Enchanted Maze Game
🎮 Enchanted Maze Game 🎮

Welcome to the Enchanted Maze Game, a fun and thrilling multiplayer adventure! 🌟 In this game, two players race through a vibrant maze, controlling their characters with different sets of keys (one uses the arrow keys, the other uses WASD). But beware! 🏃‍♂️💨 Enemies are lurking in the maze, and if you get too close, they’ll end the game for you! 😱

💡 Your Mission: Avoid enemies, collect red apples 🍎 for points, and work together with your partner to reach the goal! The game ends if anyone makes a mistake, but to truly complete the challenge, both players need to collide with each other to finish the game! 🏁

Inspired by the classic vibes of Pac-Man and Mario, this game is a product of my own imagination, packed with fun, strategy, and teamwork! 🧠💥
